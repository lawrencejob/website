## Brief

As a full-time engineer I have to be pragmatic and careful with every decision. I don't often get the opportunity to experiment with things like `<canvas>`, even though I believe these experiments make me a better programmer.

This website exists as a place I can experiment and try out technologies that serve no purpose whatsoever.
